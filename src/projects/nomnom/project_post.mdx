## Problem and Design Overview

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imageRestaurantInfoMrWest,
        alt: "A screen on our app showing information about the restaurant Mr. West. " +
             "There is a listing of the menu items. The ones you can eat are closer to the top, " +
             "like avocado toast in this example, marked with a green checkmark."
    }}
    caption={
        "NomNom shows you user-contributed data, but it also has features that " +

NomNom is an app that helps you find restaurants for yourself or a group, while
taking into account your dietary restrictions and preferences.

Dietary restrictions are common in the US.
More than half of Americans report some form of dietary restrictions, whether due to
allergies, religious or cultural practices, or personal preference.
But people can be hesitant to ask for accommodations
or assert what they actually want to eat in a group setting.
We are dedicated to the
proposition that your dietary needs do not have to either be deadly or written
off as an afterthought.

NomNom's design attempts to simplify the process of documenting dietary restrictions,
while facilitating the discovery of new restaurants that meet these requirements.
In a group setting, we also want to make it easy for your group to find food that
meets everybody's needs. Either way, your own voice and experiences should always
be valued and respected.

</ProjectImageBlock>

## Design Research Process and Key Insights

People with different dietary restrictions can have different relationships with food.
Depending on how well they are accommodated, they might also navigate the
restaurant selection process differently.
Because there are so many kinds of dietary restrictions, our design research
needs to account for this diversity.
Then, by learning about our participants' most pressing needs, we can determine
what priorities require our attention.

We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews
to understand how our participants select restaurants, how they navigate group dining if they have
dietary restrictions, and how they accommodate other people with these restrictions.
The semi-structured format allowed our participants to tell us what they feel is notable and
allowed us to follow-up with questions about their decision-making process. Afterwards, we 
performed coding for common experiences, and those codes became our research insights.

We interviewed four people who we know are food lovers, but they have different dietary restrictions
and follow those restrictions with varying strictness.
Our participants vary in stages of life and restaurant dining frequencies.
They also cover all of the types of dietary restrictions we know of—diagnosed allergies, religious
practices, adopted diets, and no dietary restrictions at all—and
and we wanted to be intentional about diversifying our participant pool in this respect.

### Eating with a group is the most pressing, unresolved problem

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePrototypeVoting,
            alt: "A paper prototype of our voting screen, with restaurant info and Yes, Meh, and Veto buttons."
        },
        {
            src: imageFoodPartyVotingButtons,
            alt: "Three voting buttons, all of different colors: Yes, Meh, and Veto. There is also a cancel button. "
        },

>
> —<cite>Participant 4, Assignment 2d</cite>

Our research shows that dining with a group is often the most challenging and unresolved
issue for our participants. 

This is a complex process, from each person having to share their dietary restrictions, to
people suffering from indecision or just hating to be the person to decide for a group. As the number of group
members increases, this frustration also grows exponentially.

### Restaurant discovery should be a first-class task

> I use DoorDash exclusively, because it has my top restaurants [...] and
> I like it creates an algorithm for me.
>
> —<cite>Participant 1, Assignment 2c</cite>

We found that people are in fact eager to explore and share new restaurants,
even if they do not consistently have the opportunity to do so.

Our participants shared that they all maintain a list of “safe restaurants” that
they frequently revisit if they do not know where to eat.
However, they also all expressed a desire to try new places, as long as that process
feels safe and not exhausting.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### The ability to self-track-and-report matters, because third-party data alone can not be trusted

> I prefer not to eat meat at all, unless it comes from a restaurant that I know cooks
> their meat completely through.
>
> —<cite>Participant 1, Assignment 2c</cite>

We found that being able to self-track
and report dietary restrictions and restaurant experiences is an important need.


Even if a restaurant claims to be accommodating to a specific dietary restriction, there may
still be cross-contamination issues in the kitchen. And many issues such as poor service
or bad communication cannot be predicted by third-party data sources and require “actual suffering”.

Relying solely on business-provided data alone, as modern map apps typically do,
is not enough to keep people safe.
Our product must allow users to track their own experiences in some way.
Even at the prototype stage,
it is just inconceivable that there is a perfect external data source that we can 100% rely on without
the chance for user input.

## Iterative Design Process and Key Insights

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imagePrototypeAll,
            caption: `Our initial paper prototype consists of phone-sized paper cutouts.`,
            alt: "A set of hand-drawn paper cut outs of iPhone screens, each containing a screen of our app. " +
                 "They all depict a rough sketch of what will become the digital prototype of our app."
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"500px"}
>

After creating tasks based on our design research and finalizing the mobile app format
to design for, we narrowed our scenarios down to:

- Finding a restaurant for everyone when you dine with a group for the first time.
- “Red-flagging” a restaurant after having a disappointing experience.

Our design process began with creating an initial paper prototype. For that, we included the necessary
features for our tasks. We then conducted heuristic evaluations and usability testing on the paper
prototype:
- First, we invited two other groups in CSE 440 to give us
feedback on the design based on [Jakob Nielsen's usability heuristics](http://web.archive.org/web/20201130102822/https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/).
- Then, we invited four additional participants, who are not in this class, to participate
in a usability study.

After each round of feedback, we made revisions to improve the design, and those revisions
would flow downstream to our digital prototype.

### Designing against the abusive ex-partner

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imageLeaveButtonsMarked,
        alt: "The paper prototype's New Group screen. There is a list of members, and at the corner " +
             "of each entry, there is now an 'X' mark that we highlight with a red rectangle. There is also " +
             "a cancel button, also highlighted similarly."
    }}
    caption={
        "We retroactively added features to kick out a member and to leave a "
        + "group in a Food Party."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Designing for
vulnerable populations should not be an afterthought, but when creating our initial prototype,
we did not account for potential issues related to online safety.
In our usability testing, some participants tried to look for escape hatches but could not find them.

For example, in our group Food Party feature, once a user gets invited by somebody, they would be forced to
finish the entire restaurant selection workflow—which requires everybody else's consensus—and had no
easy way to leave the process early.
For one participant, the _lack_ of an escape feature was noticeable and almost seemed confusing. For
this particular case, we added a way to leave a group, among other similar features
(such as being able to remove someone from a group).

</ProjectImageBlock>

### Internal state changes are not obvious to everyone

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imageAddedHistoryText,
        alt: "A paper prototype screen with text, Congrats, you're going to: Restaurant Name. The restaurant title " +
             "is layered on top of a picture of the food. Notably, there is a small help message " +
             "at the very bottom that tells you this restaurant has been added to your history."
    }}
    caption={
        "Messages like this one explicitly describe changes in internal state."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"300px"}
>

During our design process, we made an unintentional assumption that all users
would be familiar with the concept of our "History" tab, and that they would understand
how a restaurant might end up there. This tab displays both red flagged and visited restaurants,
including restaurants selected from the group Food Party feature.

During usability testing, however, it became apparent people can have different degrees of understanding
depending on their prior background with technology.
To partially address this issue, we began adding help text that describes changes in internal state
(e.g., “we also added this restaurant to your history!”).

</ProjectImageBlock>

### When we invent word usages, we have to define them

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: imageVotingExplainer,
        alt: "A tutorial screen with text: We’ll only propose restaurants that we think works for everyone, " +
             "but just to be safe, please vote either:" +
             "Yes: I want to eat here! Meh: I feel ambivalent. Veto: I can’t eat here at all!" +
             "The buttons are all different colors."
        
    }}
    caption={
        "We added explanations for our terms, especially if a feature is "
        + "used for the first time."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"300px"}
>

We received a lot of positive feedback about the voting process designed for
the group Food Party feature.
However, some participants did not find the option names (“Yes!”, “Meh”, and “Veto”) to be immediately
intuitive. We soon realized that their understanding of the features depended on the order with
which we prescribed our tasks in usability testing.

We cannot expect that our users would use our app in some specific order, so it is our job to make
sure our design allows anyone to understand our app, no matter their background.
We created an overall onboarding page that explains the features of the app before the sign-in screen.
If it is the first time that someone votes, we will also explicitly
explain how the restaurants were selected for this process and what their voting options would do.

</ProjectImageBlock>

## Resulting Design

After completing our usability testing process and drafting revisions on our paper prototype, 
we created a high-fidelity digital mockup using Figma.

- You can create a group with your friends.
- You and your group can decide on a restaurant to go to through the process of voting.
- You can document your dietary restrictions and preferences.
- You can record, rate, or flag restaurants you have previously visited.

### Onboarding

            "Slide 2: Close-up line art of two people, one person embracing and one person has a heart. " + 
            "Text: Find restaurants for you and the people you love. " + 
            "Slide 3: Line art of utensils that are crossed out in a circle. " +
            "Text: Document your dietary restrictions and preferences" + 
            "Slide 4: Comic question bubble with a sketch of a list within. Text: Remember the places you love (or don't love)." +
            "Then, a prominent button with the text of 'start my food journey.'"
            
        },

        "creates an account."
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"600px"}>

    You will see an onboarding screen the first time that use this app.
    Instead of our default landing page, you will also be directed to Profile tab to
    set your dietary restrictions.

                 "like 'nut-free', 'A1 milk', and 'crustacean shellfish', with a small 'Add' button to modify it. " +

### Restaurant information and red flagging

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: imageDigitalFlag,
            alt: "Three screens. Left: a list of restaurants, each with their images, names, " + 
                 "and tags like '4.5', two dollar signs, and 'Mexican'. " +
                 "Middle: The restaurant information page with menu items, a My Notes section, and a red flag button. " +
                 "Right: A pop up entitled 'What Happened' with options like 'Violated restriction: shellfish'."

        }
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "On a restaurant's information page, you can find menu items that work for you. " +
        "You can also record a bad experience with that restaurant by “red flagging” it."
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"600px"}>

    Our default landing page is a listing of the restaurants that meet your dietary
    restrictions. You can click on an entry to find out more about their menu.

    On the
    restaurant's own information page, you can also record other structured information,
    such as tags for yourself or to “red flag” the business—one of our major tasks.

One of our main tasks involves eating out with a group and making sure that
the restaurant selected would work for everybody. The Food Party is
a major feature in our app that is designed for that task.
