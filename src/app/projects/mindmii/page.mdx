#### MindMii helps you to reply to text messages, not simply read them!

Missed communications pose a real problem for people who use smartphones with real costs. It's not just about feeling disconnected; it can seriously strain our relationships. We've all been there, life gets crazy busy, and before we know it, we've left someone hanging without a reply. It's frustrating for both parties and can leave us wondering what went wrong. This issue is exacerbated by the nuanced nature of digital communication, where the ideal timing of our responses is influenced by various factors, including the closeness of our relationships, urgency of the matter, and proximity to each other.

## Design Research Process and Key Insights

Our initial project concept came from an identified need for better texting management and habits amongst our social circles, which particularly impacted those who are neurodivergent, are overbooked, or who manage long-distance or international connections. The goals of our design research were to uncover contributing factors that create this need, while also seeking potential patterns or lack thereof in habits, experience, and needs across different participants. Doing such research can help us to avoid oversights and assumptions as we move forward with our design.

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: brenda,
            alt: "A cartoon woman with purple hair and a teal t-shirt appears next to two stats bars. Average Response Failure: 55%, Brenda's Response Failure: 65%",
            caption: "Participant's who identified closely with the Brenda persona ",
        },
        {
            src: ava,
            alt: "A cartoon person with black hair and a beard wearing a teal jacket appears next to two stats bars. Average Response Failure: 55%, Ava's Response Failure: 80%",
            caption: "Participant's who identified closely with the Ava persona ",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"column"}
    width={5}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

We interviewed six individuals struggling with messaging responses to explore their texting habits. Three underwent three-day contextual inquiries, detailing their past month's texting history, while three participated in a three-day anonymous diary study. From this data, we identified two themes which we created two personas to better describe these trends. Join us as we delve into their messaging experiences and reveal our insights.

- **Brenda:** *Overlooks small tasks amidst a busy schedule.* 

- **Ava:** *Needing messaging support due to neurodivergence.* 

Our research helped us to identify key insights that helped us to frame specific needs participants had and influences that caused issues the participants faced in texting. Three of these key insights were:

### Response anxiety prevents responses.

Ava has a tendency to find social interactions stressful, which significantly influences the speed of their responses, especially in less-close connections where the social dynamic in less clear. This situation causes Ava to experience messaging response uncertainty, especially when faced with open-ended questions where there are a lot of possible responses.

### Unclear urgency between real life tasks and digital tasks.

Brenda often has overwhelming demands of her schedule. Brenda's daily tasks, including chores, errands, work, school, healthcare, and social engagements, often take precedence, affecting her ability to respond promptly. Ava also struggled to find a balance between the demands of their daily schedule, and how quickly they needed to respond to a given message. 

### Phone read notifications are often ignored.

Both Ava and Brenda would swipe away message notifications if they appeared at an inconvenient time. This often resulted in forgetting to respond to the message later, as it was now stashed away with a stack of "unread" messages that are hard to sort through.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Our rationale in methodology and participant selection 

Our participants included members of The Huskies for Neurodiversity student group comprised of UW students and faculty identifying as neurodivergent or allies, which connect to our project focus. The Huskies for Neurodiversity group has a discord server that a team member is part of, which could possibly facilitate remote recruitment and study of instant messaging practices. We also selected participants amongst our social circles who face overbooking (i.e., those who have overwhelmingly busy schedules and accordingly robust communication needs). This group represents a diverse range of individuals with busy lives, spanning various age groups, and the research team has the greatest access to this group for conducting contextual inquiries. Studying their messaging habits can reveal the impact of overbooked schedules on response times, response rates, and reveal specific circumstances that contribute to forgetting to reply for this population. A third source of participants informs our focus on long-distance or international communications needs. Studying the experiences of people with international connections provides insights into the complexities of cross-cultural communication and how time zone differences contribute to missed responses. Our choice of diary study research aligns with the preferences of the neurodivergent community, allowing a more comfortable way of providing research data, while also ensuring accessibility. We also request participants provide detailed emotional analyses of their interactions in the diary study, ideally providing further context to observed messaging habits. Meanwhile, the contextual inquiry approach was used to observe day-to-day use, more clearly define habits and issues, and uncover areas of the participant experience that might not be self-disclosed. Contextual inquiries also informed the development of personas that can support our iterative design approaches.

## Iterative Design Process and Key Insights

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: paperPhone,
            alt: "A paper prototype of the phone text messaging app with features to help with our tasks.",
        },
        {
            src: paperWatch,
            alt: "A paper prototype of the watch companion app with features to help with our tasks.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "The paper prototype underwent multiple changes during user testing."
    }
    width={8}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

We explored solutions based on our research using MindMii, a mobile app and companion watch app. These paper prototypes focus on two main tasks supporting message management including reminders and response. These two tasks are:

- **Easily identify and respond to missed messages**
- **Respond to a message in an appropriate amount of time**

</ProjectImagesBlock>

This iterative design process revealed further key insights which supported continued design improvement. Three of these key insights were:

### Watch notification unclear

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: paperClock,
            alt: "A paper prototype watch face showing the time, and green ring with the MindMii logo, and bold text saying URGENT.",
        },
        {
            src: paperContact,
            alt: "A paper prototype watch face showing the a phone contact named Sue and bold text saying URGENT.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "Digitally edited paper prototype images show our final suggested solution."
    }
    width={5}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

One identified issue was confusion about how to interact with the watch notification which appears as a color ring. This confusion was identified by participant feedback during paper prototype testing, when they wanted to know what to do about the color ring and weren't sure if or how to suppress or interact with the notification. To support this issue, we added a bell avatar to the color ring which provides focused and clear functionality to manage the notification by indicating interactivity to the user. During each of our 3 user tests we received questions regarding the style used to indicate an urgent massage. We decided to use words for the final paper prototype to remove any unclear understandings.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Lack of options in suggestive help

<ProjectImagesBlock
    images={[
        {
            src: aiComposePaperOriginal,
            alt: "MindMii's AI assistive reply feature provides a small selection of pre-generated responses.",
        },
        {
            src: aiComposePaper,
            alt: "MindMii's AI assistive reply feature asks the user how they can help reply to the message.",
        },
    ]}
    direction={"row"}
    caption={
        "The right-hand image showing our final design offers help based on what is asked in open-format, rather than default offering a suggested selection of potential replies."
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

Our original suggestive feature only provided texting suggestions and did not provide other types of help, another issue uncovered by paper prototype interaction from participants, as they reached a stage where they wanted to do something other than the options provided. We expanded our suggestive text helper to one that provides general help features.

</ProjectImagesBlock>

### Response options limited and unclear

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: paperReplyAssist,
        alt: "The MindMii paper prototype watch face on a reply screen showing a text 'how are you?'",
    }}
    caption={
        "By offering response assistance outside of opening a message we reduce some response anxiety that is cause by fear of 'leaving someone on read.'"
    }
    width={4}
    maxHeight={"400px"}
>

The app's message response management interface focused on replying without offering other options such as accessing help. This was another issue uncovered through paper prototype use by participants (we found the paper prototype very effective in identifying many of the most severe issues in our design). The ability to access features like help were buried too deeply in our design and needed to be hoisted into the earlier parts of interaction as well, and we noticed based on feedback that more types of help should be provided in addition to increased access to the help/AI suggestions. We added assistive buttons to the text screen to provide help as an alternative to drafting a response.
