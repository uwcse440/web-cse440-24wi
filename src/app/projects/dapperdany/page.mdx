## Problem and Design Overview

{/* A ProjectImageBlock displays text with an associated image.
  * - The image is configured through properties on the opening `ProjectImageBlock` tag.
  * - Text is placed within the opening and closing `ProjectImageBlock` tags.
  * - In a small browser window, the image will be rendered below the text.
  * - In a large browser window, the image will be rendered on the right.
  *
  * - The width property controls how much of the grid is assigned to the image column.
  *   Values can be 4 (the smallest image), 6 (half the width of the page), or 8 (the largest image).
  *
  * - The maxHeight property controls the rendered height of an image.
  *   Although the image here is 1200x800, maxHeight limits its rendered height to 400px.
  *   If not specified, the default maxHeight is 400px.
  *
  * Later in the template you will also find examples of the plural `ProjectImagesBlock` tag.

[E]very year, people in the United States throw out more than
34 billion pounds of used textiles.(BU - Lundberg and Devoy)
The recycling of clothing is rare as well. [O]nly 15% of used textiles are theoretically ‘recycled’, 
and of those, up to half are simply shipped abroad to other countries, largely in the Global South 
where they land in landfills.(BU - Lundberg and Devoy)
If people gained the capability to track which clothes they wore the least and were incentivized
in some way to donate them, we could significantly reduce the number of clothes wasted every year. <br/> <br/>
This leads us to our design, Dapper Dany, the smart mirror paired with a phone app used to assist people
in keeping track of clothes worn regularly, promoting donating unused clothes and learning about
brand sustainability practices. Our design has many features which streamlines the process of reducing
waste for the average person. Some including: line charts displaying monthly statistics of the percentage
of clothes worn in a wardrobe and clothes donated, clothing brand sustainability information on the 
mirror when clothes are worn in front of the mirror, incentivizing donating clothes by giving points
to people to use for decorating their mirror when unused clothes are donated and many more.

## Design Research Process and Key Insights

We wanted to understand why there is so many textile waste every year. The first approach we 
considered to understand the cause of this problem is people's personal habits when it comes to
how often they use most of their clothes in their closet and what they do when they have clothes
they don't want any more. By understanding the cause of the issue, we can then proceed with solutions. <br/> <br/>
We restricted our research to target people around the ages of 18-25 since people around
these ages are more interested in fashion and are more influenced by social media and
trends regarding fashion. There has been more consumption and waste of clothes in the past decade 
due to social media promoting fast fashion. There are many videos online about clothing 
hauls from fast fashion brands like Shein where people promote and unbox large amounts 
of cheap clothing they buy from these brands. Due to how prevalent fast fashion is becoming in
social media and how much waste fast fashion promotes, the 18-25 age demographic is best
to target in our goal of creating a design focused on reducing textile waste. <br/> <br/>
We designed two surveys which asked questions about demographic information 
(age, college status, and gender), clothing usage (only included in the second survey) 
and purchasing habits, brand knowledge, personal sustainability habits and interest 
regarding clothing usage tracking (only included in the second survey). The surveys
were distributed to friends, Ed Stem, UW discord servers, a r/SampleSize reddit thread and
the UW Fashion RSO Mesh. We received 28 responses for the first survey and 52 responses for 
the second survey. We created surveys to obtain the most information we can in a short amount of
time to obtain different perspectives and backgrounds in our demographic as well as allowing us 
to see patterns in people's behaviors leading to textile waste.

### An Underinformed Population

Of the 80 people who responded to the survey, none of them were accurate in their estimation regarding the 
amount of textile waste every year in the United States. The closest person was several billion above the 
actual answer, but almost all of the other particpants guessed billions of pounds less. The varied, inaccurate
responses showed our team that information about textile waste is not widely known and isn't really a piece of
information seek out on their own. This insight helped us understand that it was important to spread this fact
and more about sustainability issues to the people involved with our design.

### Efficieny Is Key

    images={[
        {
            src: howmuchwaste,
            alt: "A mound of textile waste with a red question mark",

            style: { maxWidth: '50%', maxHeight: '400px' }
        },
        {
            src: toomuchwork,
            alt: "A person falling into their overfull wardrobe",
            caption: "Listing a person's entire wardrobe can be a tiresome, frustrating chore",
            style: { maxWidth: '50%', maxHeight: '400px' }
        },
    ]}

People already have busy lives, so asking them to add something new to their routine can sometimes
be daunting. We found that the busyness of people's lives became exceedingly relevant when we asked
our participants about their major concerns regarding our designs. The overwhelming response was that
people were hesitant to manually log all their clothing into an app, and that this process would likely
deter them from using our design if it was required. After learning this information, our team realized
we needed to find a way to make it easy and automatic for a person to track everything in their wardrobe.
Not only that, but if we could automate other tasks, like documenting current outfit choices, this might
make our design even more appealing to our intended audience.

### People Don't Wear Everything They Own

Our team agreed that we had more clothes than we actually wore, but we wondered how applicable this was to
the rest of the population. To handle this curiosity, we asked the participants in our survey what percentage of 
clothing they own do they wear regularly. As we expected, only 7.4% of the participants said they wore 90% or more
of the clothing items they owned. Additionally, more than half said they wore two thirds of their clothing our less
with 17% saying they wore less than 33%. The numbers revealed from our survey showed us that people owned way more
clothing than was necessary. We decided that we should help provide a way in our design to help people dispose of
these unused clothes without adding to the textile waste problem.

## Iterative Design Process and Key Insights

We focused on all six of our tasks when creating our design.
<ol>
  <li>Keeping track of all a person's clothes in their closet after a new purchase.</li>
  <li>Learning of sustainability issues in Shein.</li>
  <li>Donating clothes that are no longer worn, or rarely worn.</li>
  <li>Maintaining how often a clothing item is worn.</li>
  <li>Walking to the nearest Goodwill and donating clothes.</li>
  <li>Sharing how many clothes someone donated in the past month with friends.</li>
</ol>
All six tasks were chosen because task 2-6 were connected to our idea of promoting sustainability in textile waste, while task 1 was necessary for the functionality of keeping track of clothes for sustainability awareness. We believe all tasks were necessary for the individual’s benefit when interacting with our design. Some of our tasks closely relate to each other, so we were able to merge them based on patterns we observed from our previous research.  <br/> <br/>
For our first design process, we came up with three designs: a clothes usage/donating tracking
app, a mirror with an attached camera to scan and determine clothing usage, and a magnetic
clip tracker which clips to the clothing pieces and pairs using bluetooth with an app.
We ended up combining the strengths of all three designs into our final design--a mirror with a camera paired with an app. The mirror created a quick way to input outfits worn daily, the first app design had extensive information about clothes usage and donation tracking while the app in the magnet design had helpful location features which assists people in finding
the most convenient donation center to donate clothes to. Combining all three designs creates a
convenient, efficient and informative way to assist users in tracking and bettering their clothing
usage habits.

### Consistency And Transitions Between The App And The Mirror Are Paramount

<ProjectImageBlock
    image={{
        src: mirrortransition,
        alt: "The mirror popup directing to the phone, and the notification on the phone",
    }}
    caption={
        "Making clear and easy to follow prompts on the mirror and phone streamlines the design's functionality"
    }
    width={6}
    maxHeight={"400px"}

Initially, after clicking the donating button on the mirror, new funcions would be available within the app without notifiying 
the user of the change. After performing our usability tests, our participants noted that this was a bit of a clunky interaction
and likely wouldn't have understood it had we not placed the new phone prototype in front of them. Additionally, for a a person
inexperienced with our design it could be could be confusing to click the donation button on the mirror with little feedback to
confirm to them that the process has begun. To resolve this issue, we made sure to clearly label where the next step would take
place and help coach the user along the way through popups and alerts in both the app and the mirror interface. In the end, the
transition makes a lot more sense and will be more friendly to people new and expert with the design.
