# Assignment 1: Project Proposal

{/*
<Alert severity='error'>Content is Under Development and Subject to Change</Alert>
*/}

## Overview

You are to propose a __problem__ and an __approach__ that could form the basis of a project for this course.
Successful projects will observe the need for good human-centered design in an interactive computing system,
analyze the needs and opportunities in the problem, explore potential designs, and propose a compelling solution.


### Project Theme

The theme for projects in this course is __self-tracking and everyday interaction with personal intelligences__.

People have long sought to better understand themselves, but continuing technology advances enable new approaches.
Students will examine problems people encounter in gathering and gaining value from personal data,
then explore how design insights and/or machine intelligence can
help go beyond simple data fetishes to support people in using personal data as part of reaching their goals.

Understanding and designing for self-tracking is also known as personal informatics:

<html>
  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    <p>
      Personal informatics systems are systems that help people collect
      personally relevant information for the purpose of self-reflection and gaining self-knowledge.
    </p>
    <footer class="blockquote-footer">
      [<CourseInformationLink linkName="linkReadingPersonalInformatics" anchorText="Li et al., 2010" />].
    </footer>
  </blockquote>
</html>

Self-tracking and personal informatics are related to the [Quantified Self](http://quantifiedself.com/) movement, which describes itself as:

<html>
  <blockquote class="blockquote">
    <p>
      Self-knowledge through numbers.
    </p>
    <footer class="blockquote-footer">
      [<CourseInformationLink linkName="linkReadingQuantifiedSelf" anchorText="Gary Wolf, 2009" />].
    </footer>
  </blockquote>
</html>

Instead of limiting self-tracking to dashboards for an isolated self-analyst,
consider the many different ways people might gather and interact with personal data,
together with how machine intelligence might add meaningful value to these activities.

Tracking can therefore take many forms:

- wearable sensors
- phone and watch applications
- appliances and other artifacts in the environment
- hybrid and multi-device forms (e.g., mobile capture with later annotation or review)

Tracking can include many social contexts:

- people seeking help from peers (e.g., social sharing, support networks)
- people seeking help from experts (e.g., health providers)
- co-located relationships (e.g., families, friends, co-workers)
- remote relationships (e.g., families, friends, co-workers)
- communities organizing (e.g., people in a building, community volunteers)

Tracking can explore new forms of interaction:

- conversational interfaces
- tangible interfaces
- ubiquitous computing interfaces

Any problem where people gather or seek value in personal data
introduces opportunities and challenges in designing for effective interaction around that data.
It can also present opportunities and challenges in
how integrated machine intelligence can provide meaningful value to that individual.

### Thinking Big

Your proposal must go beyond a technology-centric proposal of a website, phone application, or interaction.
Instead think about the problems that people face in their lives,
how we can approach those problems, and the role for interactive computing.
This first assignment is your opportunity to think broadly about identifying a problem.
Subsequent assignments will provide opportunities to focus on designing a specific technological solution to a specific set of tasks.

You should identify and consider goals and activities that are important to people. Potential domains include:

 - living a healthy life
 - managing finances effectively
 - managing time effectively
 - reducing environmental impact

Activities within personal informatics can include:

 - planning to track
 - helping remember to track
 - the actual act of tracking
 - identifying activity patterns
 - sharing accomplishments with friends and family
 - deciding to abandon tracking

Do not start with a focus on concrete one-time tasks (e.g., logging into your bank account).
Instead identify problems in long-lived activities that span many different social or technological contexts.
If you want to help people manage their money, do not immediately propose a website that addresses one specific task.
Instead consider the range of other opportunities (e.g., personal mobile devices, shared family computers, point of sale systems).

Focus on creating or improving a specific application or service that addresses the issues of specific people.
Design is rarely for "everybody", but instead generally more compelling with a more clear focus.
You must be able to create and evaluate a design within the timeframe of this course,
so consider whether you can reasonably gain access to the necessary people.

We encourage you to think big, expanding your thinking to include new ideas for interaction techniques or technology platforms.
Do not feel constrained by current devices or immediate implementation,
but instead aim to explore an exciting design that could potentially motivate the development of new enabling technology.

{/* TODO Enable examples link
Projects from prior offerings can also help you be comfortable thinking beyond immediate implementation:

<app-assignment-samples sampleToLink="website" format="list-only"></app-assignment-samples>
*/}

Finally, the project theme requires your proposal present some opportunity for __self-tracking and everyday interaction with personal intelligences__.
But you will ultimately follow your design process where it leads you, which may or may not emphasize self-tracking or machine intelligence.
Focusing on problems and opportunities, rather than specific design features,
will leave room for your design to emerge and be refined in the course of this project.

## Milestones and Deliverables

This is an individual assignment, consisting of three milestones.

{/*
  *
  * ASSIGNMENT 1A
  *
  */}
<CollapseProjectMilestone milestone={'assignment1a'}>

The goal of this milestone is to help get you started in thinking of some ideas for a potential projects.
Friday's section will then build on these in brainstorming additional potential directions for project proposals.

Propose three starting points for brainstorming domains, problems, and goals that might be supported via self-tracking.

By domain, we mean an aspect of life. Domains that are already common in self-tracking include:

- finances (e.g., tracking spending, a budget, investments)
- wellness (e.g., tracking physical activity, sleep, weight)
- health (e.g., tracking for post-surgical pain management, allergies or other personal triggers, major weight loss)
- mood (e.g., tracking mood, identifying depressive symptoms)

Be sure to focus on problems and goals, not potential design solutions.
One way to help yourself identify a hierarchy of problems and goals is to ask "Why?". For example:

- Why is a person using Mint?
- Why is a person tracking their spending?
- Why do they want to know how much they spend on leisure activities?
- Why do they have a goal of saving for a major purchase?

Each idea should be a single sentence, identifying the domain and the problem or goal.

Your ideas must be significantly different, not small variations on the same idea.
- At most one of your ideas may come from any of the domains above.
- Your other two ideas should come from two different domains that are not in the above list.

  */}
<CollapseProjectMilestone milestone={'assignment1b'} revisionMilestone={'assignment1b_rev'}>

The goal of this milestone is to propose multiple specific problems that could form the basis of a design project for this class.
Thursday and Friday will then include presenting these for feedback from peers and course staff.

Propose three specific problems that could form the basis of a design project for this class.

For each problem, in one paragraph, describe the design problem and motivation.
This description should convince the reader that this is a difficult and interesting problem, worth spending a quarter considering.
State what the problem is and why it is a problem, or describe a new idea and why it will enhance an existing application or practice.

Ensure your ideas are significantly different, not small variations on the same idea.

After receiving critique on Thursday, update your proposals ahead of additional critique on Friday.

  */}
<CollapseProjectMilestone milestone={'assignment1c'}>

The goal of this milestone is to propose and analyze a problem that will form the basis of a design project for this class.
You should build upon the feedback you have received from peers and course staff.
Although your project will iterate and evolve from this point, your group should have coalesced around an idea.

In one paragraph, describe the design problem and motivation.
This description should convince the reader that this is a difficult and interesting problem, worth spending a quarter considering.
State what the problem is and why it is a problem, or describe a new idea and why it will enhance an existing application or practice.

In another paragraph, analyze the problem or idea to give more background and context.
Do not just focus on the negative aspects of the current situation, but also identify some positive aspects that may be beneficial to retain.
A few salient examples from existing systems or practices could be used to support those claims.
If appropriate, you may conduct this analysis by describing a scenario that illustrates how someone might encounter and resolve the problem.
